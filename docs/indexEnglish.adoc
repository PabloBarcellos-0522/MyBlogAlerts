= SPEC-1: MyBlogAlerts

== Background

Myblogalerts arose from the need to automatically monitor published academic warnings
on blogs or pages of my college. The proposal is to centralize this information, to store it
In a database, and send alerts by WhatsApp as soon as new posts are detected.
This is especially useful for students who try to follow the subjects but do not always receive
The appropriate warnings in time by email.

== Requirements

*Must Have:*

* Monitor new warnings automatically by web scraping
* Store notices in Banco PostgreSQL hosted (protected key)
* Avoid duplication of posts
* Support to multiple students
* Add/remove students manually through the interface
* Send messages to WhatsApp by API (protected key)

*Should Have:*

* Simple interface in command line for use
* POOL OF CONNECTIONS WITH POSTGESQL
* Store passwords and records safely (ENV)

*Could Have:*

* Interface with automatic scheduling
* Logs and treatment of elegant errors


== Method

The project uses the Clean Architecture architecture with clear division between domain, application, infrastructure and interface. The structure consists of:

* ** SRC/Domain/**: Repository Entities and Interfaces
* ** SRC/APPLICATION/**: USE CASES such as `savapos`,` Salvaraluno` and services to send messages
* ** SRC/INFRASTRUTURE/**: SCRAPERS, POSTGESQL REPOSITIONS AND API CONNECTION
* ** src/interface/**: entry point via cli

Scrapping is done with BeautifulSoup, and data is stored in PostgreSQL
Using `Psychopg2` with` SimpleconnectionPool`. Communication with WhatsApp will be via API
Green_api with keys of APIs stored via `.env`.

CREATE SCHEMA MyBlogAlerts;

CREATE TABLE MyBlogAlerts.Student (
    idStudent INTEGER PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
    Phone_Number VARCHAR(15),
    Password VARCHAR(25),
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Registration VARCHAR(25)

    Discipline_id INTERGER NOT NULL,
    Text_Content VARCHAR

    CONSTRAINT FK_Discipline FOREIGN KEY (Discipline_id) REFERENCES discipline(idDiscipline)

    CONSTRAINT FK_Discipline FOREIGN KEY (Discipline_idDiscipline) REFERENCES MyBlogAlerts.discipline (idDiscipline)
);

== Implementation

1. Create base structure in `src/`
2. Implement Entities: `Post`,` Student`, `Discipline` and` Student_Discipline`
3. Create interfaces: `post_Repository`,` Student_Repository`, `discipline_Repository` and` Student_discipine_Repository`
4. Create scraping, postgresql repositories and connection with WhatsApp
5. Create use cases: Save post, save student
6. Create click interface with automatic loop and manual interaction
7. Implement safe connection with `.env` and pool
8. Implement the sending of monthly fee with `Send_Whatsapp_msg`
9. Deploy with command: `python -m src.interface.Cli`

== Milestones

* [x] defined initial structure
* [x] Functional PostgreSQL repositories
* [x] Scraping working
* [x] use case saving and cli
* [x] PostgreSQL connection pool
* [x] Student Manual Registration
* [x] automatic loop and click mode
* [x] Integration with WhatsApp API

== Gathering Results

Results will be validated with:

* Posts being saved correctly without duplication
* Notices delivered by WhatsApp (when activated)
* Students can be added/removed without fail
* Continuous monitoring without interruptions

Basic logs and metrics can be analyzed in the future for continuous improvement.
